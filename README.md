Anamoly Detection is also known as outlier detection. Let us understand the Outlier in the Laymen language. For instance, you are asked to remove the rotten tomatoes from bucket because if not separated it will also spoil the other good tomatoes.
Similarly, there are variable/features/data points which are of no use or making no difference but could be responsible for greater loss. Thus we need to find the Outliers and remove them for better accuracy.
The noise are the data points which are detected as the outliers.

The noise are the data points which are detected as the outliers.

Anamoly Detection is categorized into three broad categories -

1.**Supervised Anamoly Detection** In Supervised Detection, there is a classifier which classifies whether the data pints is Normal or Abnormal.

2.**Unsupervised Anamoly Detection** It detects the anomalies in the given dataset by assuming that the testing dataset contains the least fit to the remainder of the data set.

3.**Semi-Supervised Anamoly Detection** The training data set to construct the normal behaviour to the model and it checks the test data for the likelihood by the experience the model generated.

**Advantages of Anamoly Detection**

1.It can Monitor the data source, networks, users, etc.

2.It can identify the Security threads.

3.It can find the trend of the unusual behavior of the data set and handles the security and safity.

4.It can identify key outliers.

**Disadvantages**

1.The biggest Disadvantage is that it cannot identify the novelty attacks and the various existing attacks.
